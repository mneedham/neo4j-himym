						Well, it's come to this-- we're drinking with our baby in a bar.<br /><br />It is not a bar.<br /><br />It's a restaurant that happens to have a bar.<br /><br />Ergo, we are good parents.<br /><br />Unrelated: I'm getting faced right now.<br /><br />Papa needs a grease coat.<br /><br /><strong>Ted</strong>: While it is heartwarming to watch your firstborn teethe on a jalapeño popper, wasn't Mickey gonna watch him today?<br /><br />My dad's out all week.<br /><br />He's got the sniffles.<br /><br />For someone who's survived numerous beatings from loan sharks, he has a surprisingly delicate constitution.<br /><br /><strong>Ted</strong>: Well, my semester's over and the GNB building is finally done.<br /><br />If you guys want, I'm free to watch Marvin.<br /><br />I'm meeting with a headhunter next week to line up my next project, but until then, what the hell?<br /><br />Ted, although a &quot;what the hell&quot; attitude is incredibly sought after in a babysitter, I think that Lily and Marshall...<br /><br /><strong>Both</strong>: You're hired.<br /><br />Now that we've been parents for awhile, we realize that pretty much any moron can take care of a baby.<br /><br />Thank you.<br /><br />Mine!<br /><br />Ow.<br /><br />Delicious and mine.<br /><br />(Robin chuckles)<br /><br />They do look yummy yum-yum, mister.<br /><br />(giggles)<br /><br />No. No!<br /><br />What have I done?!<br /><br />I am so sorry, Cornelius.<br /><br />You deserve a better end than this!<br /><br />You got ketchup on a red tie.<br /><br />You can't even see it.<br /><br />(gasping)<br /><br />(grunts)<br /><br />Clear!<br /><br />(sobs)<br /><br />I'm going in.<br /><br />(blowing)<br /><br />Oh, my...<br /><br />Damn it, guys, we lost him.<br /><br />And he was so close to retirement.<br /><br />Just this morning he said to me, &quot;I'm getting too old for this shirt.&quot;<br /><br />(Marvin fussing)<br /><br />I know, dude.<br /><br />(humming taps)<br /><br />Oh, my God.<br /><br />You are such a good folder.<br /><br />That's, like, The Gap good.<br /><br />(giggles)<br /><br />Robin...<br /><br />...let's go hit the bar.<br /><br />At this restaurant.<br /><br />I think they have a bar here.<br /><br />Okay, what was that? What was what?<br /><br />The &quot;dumb cheerleader flirting with the quarterback&quot; thing.<br /><br />You looked like you were gonna chase Barney down with a sixer of watermelon wine coolers.<br /><br />First of all, those bad girls come in fourskis.<br /><br />And second, why would I be flirting with Barney?<br /><br />I'm not interested in him, and I made that very clear.<br /><br />With something that I did.<br /><br />Recently.<br /><br />Just spill it.<br /><br /><strong>Robin</strong>: <em>The other week, Barney made a move, but I turned him down.<br /><br />I felt awful for closing the door in his face, but he realized I was right.</em><br /><br />I'm done trying to get you.<br /><br />I can't do it anymore.<br /><br />And now I get it. Get what?<br /><br />You may have closed the door on Barney, but he locked it.<br /><br />What? No, he didn't.<br /><br />Yeah, he got the last word, and now you want what you can't have, like you always do.<br /><br />It's the classic lobster situation.<br /><br />I'm afraid you're allergic to lobster.<br /><br />You can never, ever, ever have it.<br /><br />Oh, this... is... delicious.<br /><br />Once you learned you couldn't have lobster, you became obsessed.<br /><br />Barney's the same thing.<br /><br />And this is gonna blow up in your face, just like the lobster blew up your face.<br /><br />Wrong. This is nothing like lobster.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />Just remember, you can never hook up with Barney again.<br /><br />That's fine. Never.<br /><br />Ever, ever, ever, ever.<br /><br />♪ How I Met Your Mother 8x09 ♪<br /><br />Lobster Crawl<br /><br />Original Air Date on December 3, 2012<br /><br />Oh, no.<br /><br />Marshall, Lily and Ted can't make it, for viable reasons I just learned via this text message I accidentally deleted.<br /><br />Guess it's just gonna be you and me.<br /><br />Fine by me.<br /><br />Me, too. Totally.<br /><br />Supafine.<br /><br />(giggles)<br /><br /><strong>Robin</strong>: <em>Hey there, Scherbats, your voice of reason here.<br /><br />What you doing?</em><br /><br />I hope you don't mind, but I was hungry, so I ordered MacLaren's new special.<br /><br />I couldn't eat lunch at work because they ordered<br /><br />(voice breaking): Thai food.<br /><br />I miss you, Cornelius!<br /><br />Oh, my God.<br /><br />You're so sensitive.<br /><br />And deep.<br /><br /><em>No. You're better than this.<br /><br />Barney is not like lobster.<br /><br />Okay, that's unfortunate, but it doesn't mean you have to hook up with Barney.</em><br /><br />Whoa!<br /><br /><em>God, you said that out loud!<br /><br />No, I didn't.<br /><br />How would you know? You're out of control.<br /><br />Oh, you think you're so smart, don't you, bitch?</em><br /><br />Um, billion-dollar idea alert.<br /><br />Why should bibs only be socially acceptable when you're eating lobster?<br /><br />If we could wear them all the time,<br /><br />(voice breaking): then Corny would still be with us right now.<br /><br />I miss...<br /><br />Picture a bib that looks like your suit: a collar, a tie, a jacket.<br /><br />Mm-hmm.<br /><br /><em>Atta girl. Keep it cool.</em><br /><br />I could call them Brobibs!<br /><br />That's interesting.<br /><br /><em>Yeah, you got this.<br /><br />I'm sorry I called you a bitch.</em><br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />Oh, that idea's amazeballs!<br /><br />(giggles)<br /><br /><em>That's it. I'm out of here.<br /><br />(footsteps)<br /><br />(door slams)</em><br /><br />I'm out of control.<br /><br />I came this close to telling Barney that I wanted him.<br /><br />Robin, as your friend, I got to be honest.<br /><br />I think this Brobibs thing is a frickin' gold mine.<br /><br />What? No.<br /><br />Lily, I really need advice.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />Invest now.<br /><br />Seriously, it's like Apple at ten dollars a share.<br /><br />Lily, please.<br /><br />Okay, I'm sorry.<br /><br />I'm just, I'm a little distracted.<br /><br />I-I got to get upstairs and check on Ted and Marvin.<br /><br />Can we please just talk about this Brobib thing another time?<br /><br />How was your day?<br /><br />Good, although I think I just saw a woman with a full beard outside.<br /><br />Marvin crawled!<br /><br />What?<br /><br />He's never done that before.<br /><br />I know!<br /><br />I think I just saw a guy with breasts outside.<br /><br />Marvin crawled.<br /><br />I can't believe it. Believe it.<br /><br />I took a video for you.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br /><strong>Ted</strong>: You're doing it, Marvin.<br /><br />Go, go, go, go, go.<br /><br />Oh!<br /><br />Your Uncle Ted is so proud.<br /><br />Whoops.<br /><br />Guess I had the camera flipped.<br /><br />I use it to check my teeth for debris.<br /><br />(Marvin laughing)<br /><br />Ooh, sounds like somebody's &quot;crawling&quot; me.<br /><br />(whimpering)<br /><br />Oh, sweetie, oh, come on.<br /><br />Lil, listen, so we missed the first time he crawled.<br /><br />So what?<br /><br />We'll see it the next time, I promise.<br /><br /><strong>Ted</strong>: Oh, my God, he just did it again!<br /><br />(sobbing)<br /><br />(sobbing) TED: Guys, get in here! Marvin can't stop crawling!<br /><br />He's Holden Crawl-field!<br /><br />Get in here right now--<br /><br />nope, nope, it's over.<br /><br />(whimpering)<br /><br />Okay, hey, I know.<br /><br />Baby, I know, I know.<br /><br />But, listen, there will be plenty of other Marvin firsts.<br /><br />His first day at school, his first trip to meet Santa, his first touchdown pass for the 2032 Super Bowl champion Vikings-- no pressure.<br /><br />I'll love him even if he runs the ball into the end zone.<br /><br />So can we please just let this crawling thing go?<br /><br />Yeah, okay. You're right.<br /><br />I mean, I'm being nuts.<br /><br />We'll see it when we see it.<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />Do it.<br /><br />If you ever want to see these boobs again, crawl, you son of a me.<br /><br />Come on, Lil.<br /><br />You know what they say: a watched tot never crawls.<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />Or calls you later in life, after it sees this disturbing footage.<br /><br />Hey, Lily, Marshall.<br /><br />Uh, Lily, we need to talk.<br /><br />Oh, that sounds serious!<br /><br />Oh, you guys should talk about it down at the bar until after Marvin's asleep.<br /><br />And if you want to stay down there until after SportsCenter's over, that's fine, too.<br /><br />Ooh.<br /><br />Keep shooting.<br /><br />If you miss it, I'm leaving you.<br /><br />(Marvin giggles)<br /><br />Yeah, that seems about right.<br /><br />Sorry if I'm bad company.<br /><br />I'm not sure anything is gonna take my mind off of missing Marvin's first crawl.<br /><br />Lily, I've had a revelation.<br /><br />Brobibs for women.<br /><br />Bitchbibs!<br /><br />You know Barney's gonna sue us, but damn it, let's just go for it.<br /><br />No, Lily, this is serious.<br /><br />When that doctor told me I couldn't eat lobster and I did it anyway, it almost killed me.<br /><br />But here's the thing: I never wanted lobster again.<br /><br />So the solution is obvious.<br /><br />The only way to get Barney out of my system is to get him into my system, one last time.<br /><br />It's brilliant, right?<br /><br />Not brilliant at all.<br /><br />Thanks for being on board. Not on board.<br /><br />It means a lot. Big mistake.<br /><br />You're my girl.<br /><br />Now it's just a question of how to get him...<br /><br />(panting): Hey, Robin, I just got your text.<br /><br />What's the big emergency?<br /><br />Hi, Barney!<br /><br />You seem like you run fast.<br /><br />Do you want me to fan you with my <em>US</em> magazine?<br /><br />He's fine. Thanks, Patrice.<br /><br /><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content">

(yells)<br /><br />Look, I don't agree with your lobster quest, but I can't stand watching you make a fool of yourself.<br /><br />You want the fix? I got the fix.<br /><br />Back in college...<br /><br /><em>it was love at first sight for me and Marshall, but when it came to making the first move, well, he needed help.<br /><br />So I took matters into my own hands.</em><br /><br />♪<br /><br />Let's get out of here.<br /><br />You just need a girl who, I don't know, gets a few drinks in her and wants to have fun and put on a show. Mm-hmm.<br /><br />And it drives guys crazy, 'cause you both don't even care.<br /><br />It's just stupid and fun.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />Lily, that sounds perfect. Thank you.<br /><br />Mm.

Ow.<br /><br />It's late.<br /><br />I'm so tipsy.<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />It is late. We should get out of here.<br /><br />So, Brandi, ever sneak into the studio and do it in front of the weather map?<br /><br />No. Why do you ask?<br /><br />No reason.<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />Someone is about to get unseasonably banged.<br /><br />Damn it!<br /><br />What did I do wrong?<br /><br />Nothing. It was awesome. Oh, Marshall, let's go!<br /><br />Hey. Hey, Lilypad!<br /><br />So, don't be upset.<br /><br />Ted... took Marvin shopping and sort of bought him... all his winter clothes.<br /><br />(Lily squeals)<br /><br />TED (over baby monitor): Get ready for our star runway model--<br /><br />or should I say, our star <em>crawlway</em> model.<br /><br />He's doing it again, guys! Get in here!<br /><br />N-No-no, it's over.<br /><br />That's it. Ted's fired.<br /><br />Fired? No, c-come on, Lily, he's helping us out.<br /><br />Plus, next week, your dad'll be back, and Ted has the meeting with that headhunter.<br /><br />Let's just stay cool.<br /><br /><strong>Ted</strong>: Starting at quarterback, the pride of Cleveland...<br /><br />(gasps) Marvin Eriksen! Right?<br /><br />Right, guys? He's gonna be a little Browns fan.<br /><br />(wails)<br /><br />Oh, by the way, I cancelled that meeting with the headhunter, so I can take care of Marvin next week.<br /><br />What? No, no, my dad'll be better by then.<br /><br />Oh, I gave Mickey the month off.<br /><br />It's supposed to snow, and, uh, Uncle Ted doesn't want to miss Marvin's first sleigh ride.<br /><br />You're fired. You're fired.<br /><br />Marvin has a bib with little... little dinosaurs on it.<br /><br />Maybe you should make one like that.<br /><br />Brobibs are for grown men wearing bibs, Ted.<br /><br />I don't want them looking like idiots.<br /><br />(phone rings)<br /><br />Lily, Marshall, you know you can't keep him away from me.<br /><br />He's gonna start asking questions.<br /><br />Calm down, Ted.<br /><br />We-we just wanted to apologize.<br /><br />We overreacted before.<br /><br />Mm-hmm.<br /><br /><strong>Lily</strong>: Meet us at the swim class you apparently signed Marvin up for.<br /><br />Bubble Buddies?

Where's Marvin?<br /><br />Does Coach Amber have him warming up in the Jacooz?<br /><br />Sorry again.<br /><br />Aw, hey, buddy, listen, we wanted to talk to you about how you've kind of been overdoing it with Marvin.<br /><br />I haven't been overdoing it.<br /><br />Ted, we're in a baby swim class, and clearly you've done something extreme to get the naming rights to that lollipop bin.<br /><br /><strong>Marshall</strong>: But I-I think that we've figured out what's going on with you.<br /><br />See, after we let you go...<br /><br />What is <em>this?<br /><br />Marvin's</em> <em>Book of Firsts?</em><br /><br />(Lily gasps loudly)<br /><br />Ted took Marvin to see Santa?!<br /><br />Oh, I am gonna take this book and I'm gonna shove it so far up his...<br /><br />The point is, it made us remember another scrapbook you made.<br /><br />That project really was your baby, and now it's over, and you're scared to move on.<br /><br />I poured my blood, sweat and tears into that building.<br /><br />Though, to be fair, a lot of that happened the day I accidentally fell down the elevator shaft.<br /><br />Mm.<br /><br />The point is, it's just really hard to let go.<br /><br />Especially when that building's my biggest accomplishment.<br /><br />I mean, maybe if I was where you guys are at in life, with all you have to be proud of...<br /><br />We get it, okay?<br /><br />You're always gonna be Uncle Ted.<br /><br />But if Marvin can't be your next project, you need one of your own, and so we rescheduled your meeting with that headhunter.<br /><br />He's over there.<br /><br />Which one is he?<br /><br />Thanks, guys.<br /><br />Marvin and I are lucky you're our parents.<br /><br />Aw.<br /><br />Oh, hey, Ted?<br /><br />It's kind of a big, professional meeting--<br /><br />you might want to trade out that lollipop for a shirt.<br /><br />(chuckles): Yeah.<br /><br />I'll just give it to one of these kids. Oh, buddy.<br /><br />What? You're half naked, you're not a parent to any of these children--<br /><br />don't offer 'em candy.<br /><br />I can't believe Barney went home with Brandi.<br /><br />I should have asked <em>you</em><br /><br />to do that play with me.<br /><br />Well, it's too late now, isn't it?<br /><br />There he is. Straddle me. Start grinding.<br /><br />Nothing's off-limits.<br /><br />So, last night Brandi and I got to the WWN studios, and my high-pressure system was ready to slam into her warm front.<br /><br />The studio's unlocked, the weather map's up--<br /><br />ready to do it in 17<br /><br />different states at once?<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />Um, actually...<br /><br />I don't think I want that.<br /><br />I'm sorry.<br /><br />I'm-I'm...<br /><br />I'm gonna go.<br /><br />Wait, you didn't sleep with her?<br /><br />Nope.<br /><br />I spent the night thinking about how everything I've done since Quinn and I broke up has been a cry for help.<br /><br />Dressing a dog up like me, hooking up with all those nannies...<br /><br />Brobibs? No, those are solid.<br /><br />I still want in.<br /><br />And I realized that... I'm searching, searching for what I really want in life, and you know what?<br /><br />I have absolutely no idea what that is.<br /><br />Wow.<br /><br />Barney... But...<br /><br />I'm going to figure it out.<br /><br />I have to.<br /><br />Good night, guys.<br /><br />God, I feel awful.<br /><br />Barney is going through something big, and I've been obsessing about one stupid final hookup to get him out of my system.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />He needs space... and time to figure things out.<br /><br />And I have to give it to him.<br /><br /><em>(knocking on door)</em><br /><br />Robin? What are you doing here? It's okay if you don't know what you want in life...<br /><br />...as long as you know what you want... tonight.<br /><br />Well...<br /><br />I do know what I want.<br /><br />Hi, Robin!<br /><br />Nobody asked you here, Patrice!<br /><br />Actually, I did.<br /><br />Last night.<br /><br />Let me go see if the studio's open.<br /><br />(chuckles softly)<br /><br />All right.<br /><br />Oh, hi, Barney.<br /><br />I'm working late.<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />What are you doing here?<br /><br />I'm... (sighs)<br /><br />I don't know what I'm doing... here.<br /><br />Barney... I don't know you that well, but... are you okay?<br /><br />Yeah. What do you mean?<br /><br />Well, whenever I see someone unhappy, I get the urge to give them cookies, and I really want to give you cookies right now.<br /><br />Cookie?<br /><br />Lame. No, thanks.<br /><br />You sure? They're heart-shaped.<br /><br />Sorry, a couple of them are broken.<br /><br />(sobbing): I know how they feel. I'd love one.<br /><br />After that, I sent Brandi packing, and Patrice and I talked all night.<br /><br />We're... kind of on a date right now.<br /><br />But if you'd like to throw on some clothes and join us for Crazy Eights...<br /><br />I can deal you in!<br /><br />My deck has puppies on it!<br /><br />Arf-arf!<br /><br />Um...<br /><br />I... got to go.<br /><br />Look, I still feel bad I went too far with all the Marvin firsts--<br /><br />the Santa thing, especially.<br /><br />I mean, I should've known.<br /><br />Are you sure you guys forgive me?<br /><br />Absolutely. Don't worry, no grudges.<br /><br />Great. Next round's on me.<br /><br />Coming, honey!<br /><br />Okay, you guys have all the numbers-- my cell, the restaurant, Center for Disease Control?<br /><br />She's with her Aunt Lily and Uncle Marshall.<br /><br />Nothing's gonna happen.<br /><br />You're right.<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />You're totally right.<br /><br />Okay...<br /><br />Bye, sweetie.<br /><br />Here, you...<br /><br />Mm...<br /><br />Get out of here, ya crazy. Would you get out of here already.<br /><br />(Lily giggles)<br /><br />Who's ready to meet Santa?
