						NARRATOR: <em>Kids, it was two days before Barney and Robin's wedding, and everything was going off without a hitch.</em><br /><br />TED: Ah.<br /><br />Been waiting for the perfect time for this, and, my friend, that time is...<br /><br />I saw you and Robin at the carousel.<br /><br />(bottle shatters) <em>Okay, there was one slight hitch.</em><br /><br />BARNEY: <em>She called me to help her, and there you were in the rain holding hands with my fiancée.</em><br /><br />What up?<br /><br />Nothing up.<br /><br />Everything down.<br /><br />All parts of me down.<br /><br />Look, you were busy, so I-I...<br /><br />I went to the park to help her look for this locket she buried years ago.<br /><br />She couldn't find it, she got upset, I held her hand. End of story.<br /><br />Cool! I just wanted to air that out.<br /><br />You know, bro to bro.<br /><br />You're my best friend and my best man.<br /><br />Of course I trust you.<br /><br />Oh, come on.<br /><br />You don't have to cry about it.<br /><br />(sobs)<br /><br />It's not that.<br /><br />That was a $600 bottle of scotch.<br /><br />(crying): Oh, my God.<br /><br />(both blubbering)<br /><br />I hope Marshall gets here for the rehearsal dinner.<br /><br />Thank you, Linus.<br /><br />He's somewhere in Wisconsin in a rental car.<br /><br />Hertz? I mean, it hurts a little but I'm not gonna cry about it. Hey!<br /><br />We've been doing that all afternoon.<br /><br />ROBIN: Oh, who's that for?<br /><br />Marshpillow.<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>Kids, as you may recall, whenever Marshall left town for a few days, Lily would compensate with a body pillow she dressed up and named Marshpillow.<br /><br />Pretty normal stuff.<br /><br />But with Marshall stuck driving across the country, Lily decided to upgrade.</em><br /><br />Meet Marshpillow 2.0!<br /><br />Hey!<br /><br />Am I on?<br /><br />Hey, guys!<br /><br />Hey, Marsh. Hey, Marshall. Hey.<br /><br />It's like you're really here.<br /><br />MARSHALL: Hey, Ted.<br /><br />Can you give me a gander of the environs?<br /><br />Wow!<br /><br />This place looks beautif...<br /><br />Wait for it.<br /><br />He's frozen.<br /><br />(Lily groans)<br /><br />Same thing happened last night at the worst possible time.<br /><br />I had just gotten on all fours and taken off my panti...<br /><br />Now Lily's frozen.<br /><br />♪ How I Met Your Mother 9x04 ♪<br /><br />The Broken Code<br /><br />Original Air Date on October 7, 2013<br /><br />...ful.<br /><br />This place is beautiful!<br /><br />Wow. Lily, it looks like you really put some time into this, huh?<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />Though I wonder if instead of dressing up your giant husband doll like Malibu Ken, you could've spent a minute or two--<br /><br />I don't know... planning the weak ass bachelorette party you threw me?<br /><br />I-It's possible I forgot to send out the Evite.<br /><br />Robin!<br /><br />Happy bachelorette party!<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />You invited Patrice to my bachelorette party?!<br /><br />No.<br /><br />You know, it's funny.<br /><br />When I was planning Barney's bachelor party, <em>I managed to wrangle his boyhood hero, Billy Zabka, from</em> The Karate Kid.<br /><br />But you scored Patrice.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Robin.<br /><br />I-I've just been so consumed with our move to Rome.<br /><br />I guess I forgot to invite the girls.<br /><br />Yeah, Lily, I'd like to show you how it's done.<br /><br />Billy Zabka, what a great guy.<br /><br />Look at how thorough Ted was planning the best man poker game he's throwing for Barney.<br /><br />Wait, I think I'm on some sort of delay here.<br /><br />(clears throat) Best man visor for the dealer.<br /><br />Customized playing cards.<br /><br />Barney's the king.<br /><br />And... the queens are naked.<br /><br />It was my first decree.<br /><br />Hmm. Plus, Ted handwrote all of the table cards for the reception in calligraphy.<br /><br />The man's a wizard with a pen.<br /><br />Oh. I don't know about all that.<br /><br />Though I was approached by the decorating committee to make the... signs for our senior prom.<br /><br />I'm told they were quite the hit.<br /><br />(sucks air through teeth)<br /><br />Hey, buddy, listen, you're gonna kill me, but I forgot to bring the table cards.<br /><br />Uh, I'd hate to ask you to redo them...<br /><br />Say no more. The best man is on it.<br /><br />Thanks, Ted.<br /><br />(scoffs)<br /><br />S-So now the best man is painstakingly handwriting<br /><br />200 table cards, but my maid of honor forgot to click &quot;send&quot; on an Evite.<br /><br />I didn't forget to invite the girls to your bachelorette party.<br /><br />You have no girls!<br /><br />(high-pitched): What?<br /><br />(chuckles)<br /><br />What?<br /><br />What?<br /><br />What? I... All my girls.<br /><br />I gave you a list.<br /><br />This list?<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />&quot;Tall girl from work, &quot;mouth-breather from coffee shop, &quot;average-sized girl from that place&quot;?<br /><br />Ooh. Sorry I didn't track her down.<br /><br />She sounds great!<br /><br />She's actually kind of a bitch.<br /><br />Face it, Robin.<br /><br />You hate women, and... women hate you.<br /><br />Ted didn't go to his prom?<br /><br />Classic.<br /><br /><em>While Lily was dropping the ball as Robin's maid of honor, the best man was busy knocking it out of the park.</em><br /><br />(sucks air through teeth)<br /><br />Hey, buddy, listen, my great-aunt Ida has corns on her feet and needs a first-floor room.<br /><br />Uh, would you mind switching rooms?<br /><br />Say no more. The best man is on it.<br /><br />Thanks, Ted.<br /><br />(shouts)<br /><br />(whoops) (sucks air through teeth)<br /><br />Hey, buddy, listen, the wedding doves got here early, and I don't know where to put 'em...<br /><br />Say no more. The best man is on it!<br /><br />Thanks, Ted.<br /><br />(cooing)<br /><br />Poor guys.<br /><br />All cooped up.<br /><br />I guess there's no harm in letting you out for a bit, huh?<br /><br />They carpet-bombed my entire room.<br /><br />Wish I'd closed my suitcase.<br /><br />And my mouth.<br /><br />(sucks air through teeth)<br /><br />Hey, buddy, listen, I see you wrote &quot;N-O-period&quot; instead of the number sign.<br /><br />I'm worried that might confuse the guests...<br /><br />Say no more.<br /><br />The best man is on it.<br /><br />Thanks, Ted.<br /><br />(knocking)<br /><br />Here they are.<br /><br />Freshly penned table cards in a pretty decent chancery considering I only had my travel quills.<br /><br />Wait. Why's the poker game started?<br /><br />Oh, um, the best man moved the time.<br /><br />Mm, no, he didn't.<br /><br />Yes, he did.<br /><br />Heya, Ted.<br /><br />Thanks for the sweet lid, bro.<br /><br />(quietly): Billy Zabka's your new best man?<br /><br />He's the best... around.<br /><br />Sorry, Ted. Maybe next wedding.<br /><br />What...<br /><br />So you're playing the best man poker game without me?<br /><br />Tim Gunn's here and I'm not?<br /><br />I'm Barney's personal tailor, of course I'm here.<br /><br />Plus, I've never played poker before.<br /><br />It looks like a hoot.<br /><br />I moved into a dungeon.<br /><br />I wrote hundreds of cards.<br /><br />I even gave your batty great-aunt Ida a foot massage so vigorous it put her to sleep right there in the lobby.<br /><br />Yeah, I don't really have a great-aunt Ida.<br /><br />So you are mad about me and Robin holding hands.<br /><br />Of course I'm mad, Ted.<br /><br />Holding hands is, like, the fourth-grade equivalent of banging.<br /><br />Well, in your case, 12th grade.<br /><br />Self-five.<br /><br />You broke the Bro Code.<br /><br />No, I did not. I only went to help Robin as a friend because you didn't show up.<br /><br />I did not break the Bro Code.<br /><br />It's in the text.<br /><br />A bro shall not have a weird moment with another bro's fiancée. Well, too bad we're in Farhampton and can't actually check.<br /><br />I am pleased to announce that the Bro Code has replaced the Gideons Bible at select hotels throughout the country.<br /><br />Oh.<br /><br />I'm sorry I said you hate women.<br /><br />Yeah, don't be.<br /><br />For whatever reason, I just...<br /><br />(sighs) I can't seem to connect with them. Down!<br /><br />Can you help me? I've got a bunch more wedding gifts in the van.<br /><br />Yay! I love Robin so much!<br /><br />(quietly): Oh, God, I'm gonna strangle that bitch.<br /><br />Robin, what is it with you and women?<br /><br />(groans)<br /><br />They're so annoying.<br /><br />I'm glad that you're my only female friend.<br /><br />Girls are always whining and crying over every little thing.<br /><br />(groans)<br /><br />(crying)<br /><br />Yes. That's exactly...<br /><br />Thank you. &quot;Oh, oh, boo-hoo.<br /><br />&quot;Look at me. I'm a sensitive little girl...&quot; Oh. God, I'm sorry.<br /><br />You're actually crying.<br /><br />(groans)<br /><br />It's just so sad.<br /><br />(sobs)<br /><br />I can't be your only girlfriend. Well, I...<br /><br />I don't need anybody else. I got... I got you.<br /><br />For another six days and then I'm off to Rome for a year.<br /><br />(gasps) What are you gonna do without our Saturday morning brunch with a side of sassy gossip?<br /><br />A one-shot power play?!<br /><br />Hey! Hey, Boston!<br /><br />Why not drop your hockey pants and actually take a dump on the ice next time?!<br /><br />(cackles)<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />(groans)<br /><br />See? It is just too horrible to even think about.<br /><br />Yeah. You... need another female friend.<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />Whenever I try to talk to women, they look like they want to punch me.<br /><br />Well, maybe you're accidentally giving off the wrong vibe.<br /><br />Like, what do you say to other women at the gym?<br /><br />Oh, well, I haven't been to the gym in forever.<br /><br />My metabolism is all messed up.<br /><br />See, I can moose down a pint of fudge ripple for a midnight snack and wake up having lost weight.<br /><br />(groans)<br /><br />Well, everywhere except for my boobs.<br /><br />So annoying.<br /><br />You're gonna need a lot of work.<br /><br />It's in here. Somewhere.<br /><br />I... It has to be.<br /><br />Damn it, I know I should've done these in alphabrotical order.<br /><br />(groans)<br /><br />Who cares about the Bro Code?<br /><br />It's just some stupid book you made up.<br /><br />(gasps)<br /><br />How dare you?<br /><br />The Bro Code has been around for centuries.<br /><br />Nay... whatever's more than centuries.<br /><br />Please don't launch into a fake history lesson.<br /><br />The Bro Code can trace its lineage all the way back to Broses himself.<br /><br />Article one: bros before ho's.<br /><br />TED: <em>Okay.</em><br /><br />I see what you're doing. You can't prove that I broke the Bro Code, so you're just making up stories about...<br /><br />This sacred text was eventually brought to the New World in 1776 by none other than Christopher Brolumbus.<br /><br />Article 62: a bro who calls dibs first has dibs.<br /><br />Oh? Dibs!<br /><br />And that's why he got to bang Pocahontas.<br /><br />Pocahontas was with John Smith.<br /><br />Maybe according to the hotel register.<br /><br />Whatever Mrs. Brolumbus didn't know couldn't hurt her, am I right?<br /><br />Well, except maybe that New World syphilis.<br /><br />But I digress.<br /><br />Barney, if you believe in the Bro Code, how come you've broken it so many times?<br /><br />(gasps loudly)<br /><br />How dare you!<br /><br />I have <em>never</em> broken the Bro Code!<br /><br />Hmm? Hmm? Ah.<br /><br />&quot;Article 104: the mom of a bro is always off limits.&quot;<br /><br />Okay, look, we've all had a lot of fun joking about me banging your mom.<br /><br />Not all of us. Continue.<br /><br />But I swear nothing ever happened between the two of us.<br /><br />Trust me.<br /><br />And what's going on with your fingers?<br /><br />(whispering): That's how our bodies were intertwined.<br /><br />All right, this is ridiculous!<br /><br />It's ridiculous that you won't admit holding Robin's hand was weird.<br /><br />It wasn't weird!<br /><br />Yes, it was.<br /><br />You know what?<br /><br />We need a third impartial bro to settle this.<br /><br />To resolve this, I really need to parse the text of the Bro Code.<br /><br />It's too bad Marshall doesn't have a copy.<br /><br />Actually, I do.<br /><br />They were in the, uh, seat back pockets on my flight in place of the safety cards.<br /><br />I'm also pleased to announce<br /><br /><em>The Bro Code</em> is now available in select airlines across the country.<br /><br />And Lufthansa.<br /><br /><em>Der Bro Code</em> is, like, huge in Germany.<br /><br />Okay, so prove to me you can make a female friend.<br /><br />What about her?<br /><br />Ugh! The girl with the bangs?<br /><br />Any chick who does that to her hair is going through a big life transition I don't want to hear about.<br /><br />Next time, grow your bangs long enough to cover your mouth.<br /><br />Ha-pass.<br /><br />Okay, well... what about her?<br /><br />Ugh! Comfortable shoes?<br /><br />(laughing)<br /><br />What, are you filibustering later?<br /><br />It's after 5:00. Put on some heels.<br /><br />Ha-pass.<br /><br />Okay, well, what about...? Ugh!<br /><br />I haven't even pointed to anyone yet!<br /><br />MARSHALL: <em>Now,</em> although not expressly stated in the Bro Code, a weird moment between a bro and his bro's fiancée is, in my bropinion... a violation.<br /><br />No! Yes! However, Ted was helping Robin as a friend.<br /><br />Therefore, holding her hand isn't <em>necessarily</em> a weird moment.<br /><br />No! Yes!<br /><br />That being said...<br /><br />What?<br /><br />(mutters)<br /><br />...if we decide that holding <em>any</em> friend's hand is weird, then, yes, Ted did break the Bro Code.<br /><br />So, the question is this.<br /><br />If Ted had gone to the park and held <em>Barney's</em> hand, would it have been weird?<br /><br />No? Yes?<br /><br />See?<br /><br />(scoffs)<br /><br />It's not weird at all.<br /><br />I don't know what to say.<br /><br />Just be yourself.<br /><br />Say something nice.<br /><br />Which one? I can't do both.<br /><br />Slut alert.<br /><br />That's my 14-year-old daughter.<br /><br />Crappy mom alert.<br /><br />Ugh!<br /><br />It's you. Nice bangs.<br /><br />What is wrong with you?!<br /><br />I can't do this, okay?<br /><br />I was raised as a boy.<br /><br />I don't get along with women.<br /><br />Can we just drop it?<br /><br />Okay, I never thought I'd take a page out of your fiancé's playbook, but... it's time to target the crying chick.<br /><br />Not weird at all.<br /><br />BARNEY: Marshall, why are we doing this?!<br /><br />Two dudes on a beach with a lifeless blob they're pretending is alive?<br /><br />It's stupid.<br /><br />So, I guess that means<br /><br /><em>Weekend at Bernie's</em> is stupid, too.<br /><br />(gasps)<br /><br />E-Lawyered.<br /><br />Now, before I can render a decision, we need to recreate the variables at the carousel as closely as possible.<br /><br />Since Ted says that he was comforting Robin, he needs to do the same for Barney, so, Ted, comfort Barney.<br /><br />I don't see how that...<br /><br />Comfort... Barney.<br /><br />(sputters)<br /><br />Barney, what is going on with you?<br /><br />Why are you so upset with me?<br /><br />Marshall, this is stupid! I don't...<br /><br />Accept the comfort.<br /><br />Fine!<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />I guess... I'm not really mad at you.<br /><br />I'm mad at myself. I should have met Robin at the carousel when she called, but I was having such a good time greasing 12-year-olds.<br /><br />Laser tag.<br /><br />Helpful. Continue.<br /><br />Look, Ted, I'm sorry that I've been taking it out on you.<br /><br />You were just being a good friend to Robin.<br /><br />It's okay.<br /><br />It would be different if you still had feelings for her, but you don't, right?<br /><br />Right?<br /><br />(thunder booming)<br /><br />Okay, now it's weird.<br /><br />You still have feelings for Robin?!<br /><br />What?! What?! What?! What?!<br /><br />Okay, yes, sometimes I do.<br /><br />Well, then, turn 'em off!<br /><br />I would love to, but it doesn't work that way!<br /><br />I'm a... I'm a human being.

Oh, come on, ref!<br /><br />I haven't seen that much hooking go unpunished since my last trip to Vegas.<br /><br />And I was on that trip, because we are best friends now.<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />(both laughing)<br /><br />Hey, this might sound a little nutty, but how about we inject a sexual edge into our abiding friendship that...<br /><br />BOTH: ...in no way jeopardizes our emotional connection, or respective marriages?!<br /><br />(both giggling)<br /><br />LILY: <em>Aw!<br /><br />Hell,</em> no!<br /><br />Excuse me.<br /><br />I've got a Boston Brewin', if you know what I mean.<br /><br />(laughs)<br /><br />You listen, and you listen good.<br /><br />If I see your face around Robin again, you will be crying about a lot more than your precious New York Rogers.<br /><br />Rangers? I will cut you!<br /><br />(Lily mutters gibberish)<br /><br />Forgot my purse.<br /><br />(mutters)<br /><br />You know what?<br /><br />That's why I only need you.<br /><br />'Cause you're a psycho.<br /><br />My psycho.<br /><br />I am, aren't I? Mm-hmm.<br /><br />(giggling)<br /><br />There's the blushing bride!<br /><br />Back off, Patrice!<br /><br />Look, Barney, the truth is, it was weird at the carousel.<br /><br />On some level, it's probably been weird between me and Robin ever since we broke up.<br /><br />But you're my brother.<br /><br />I would never do anything to hurt you, ever.<br /><br />(scoffs)<br /><br />I mean it, I swear!<br /><br />I'll-I'll even swear it on the Bro Code.<br /><br />The Bro Code's stupid.<br /><br />(gasps)<br /><br />How dare you!<br /><br />I'd be honored.<br /><br />I can't promise that I'll ever get to a place where it won't be at least a little weird between me and Robin.<br /><br />But I don't want to lose you as a friend, either of you.<br /><br />So I will do everything I can to move on and live with it.<br /><br />The question is... can you?<br /><br />(sighs)<br /><br />I'm sorry, Ted. I just... can't do this.<br /><br />I fold.<br /><br />What about the best man?<br /><br />I fold, too.<br /><br />I fold.<br /><br />There goes my belly buster.<br /><br />You sandbag all night, only to bluff a couple of rags, pre-flop, and wind up with a dry board.<br /><br />That's what you get for limping in shorts-tacked with a pack of donkeys.<br /><br />Muck city.<br /><br />I fold!<br /><br />Yeah... Oh, right. I knew that.<br /><br />I knew that, I knew that, I knew that.<br /><br />Okay, two players left.<br /><br />You are bluffing, robot man.<br /><br />I raise.<br /><br />BARNEY: Oh.<br /><br />Hey, Billy, do you mind pushing my chips into the center of the pot?<br /><br />Preferably with gusto, because...<br /><br />I'm all in!<br /><br />Oh! Oh, boy!<br /><br />All right, all right. ALL: Oh!<br /><br />(cheering and laughing)<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>And that's how I became Barney's best man again.<br /><br />Everything was back to going off without a hitch.</em><br /><br />I'm coming for you, Mosby.<br /><br />NARRATOR: <em>Okay, there was one slight hitch.</em>
