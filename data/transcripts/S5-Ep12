						In 2030, Ted tells his children the story of the encounter with their mother.<br /><br />Ted (2030): Children, you never know when you will meet someone important. It's not as if life warned you. You look, and they are there.<br /><br />Ted comes out of his classroom and in the corridors, he sees a group of young people with packs of beer.<br /><br />Student: Come on, let's go get stoned on the roof.<br /><br />Ted (2030): No, not this guy. It.<br /><br />Student: Do not bother, Boomer.<br /><br />Student: I do not call me Boomer.<br /><br />Student: For me, this is your name.<br /><br />Ted: Gentlemen, I am a professor at this university and you are minor, so it is my duty to confiscate it, and that, and... the cooler?You know what, Boomer? You can keep it.<br /><br />Ted returned to his classroom with a student.<br /><br />Student: Each week, a guy in a fraternity invites me to a party and I said &quot;I am preparing my PhD and I write a thesis which is entitled Foreign Direct Investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. &quot;<br /><br />Ted: And they will respond?<br /><br />Student: &quot;It's sexy. &quot;<br /><br />Ted: Actually, it's really sexy.<br /><br />Student: I have a confession to make. I recognize you. Do you remember the first day of last semester? Advanced Eco?<br /><br />Ted (2030): Children, do you remember the history of bad amphitheater.<br /><br />Flashback<br /><br />Ted (2030): I thought I was in architecture intro, I was in advanced eco. Of course, I did not know that your mother was in the auditorium, and she took me for an idiot.<br /><br />End flashback<br /><br />Student: I took you for an idiot. But a very cute idiot.<br /><br />Ted: You go out with idiots cute?<br /><br />Student: Almost all the time.<br /><br />GENERIC<br /><br />Ted is in his apartment with Robin, Barney and Lily.<br /><br />Ted: She wants to do a doctorate, she reads the philosophy for fun, she finished the crossword in the Sunday New York Times.<br /><br />Barney: Ted, I am happy for you. Sorry, not for you, not to be you.<br /><br />Ted: To summarize, I have a date tonight. (We hear screaming outside) Thank you, New York! I try not to screw up.<br /><br />Lily: What's going on? There are queuing outside the McLaren's.<br /><br />Robin: Why it's almost that guys?<br /><br />Barney: Only two things can cause this turmoil.<br /><br />Ted, Robin, Lily and Barney are down at the bar where all the guys at the counter.<br /><br />Barney: Ladies and gentlemen, the McLaren's hired a sexy barmaid.<br /><br />Lily: Look at all these guys. The sidewalk will feel the pee now.<br /><br />Robin: We'd better find a new bar.<br /><br />Barney: What... are you crazy? It's a sexy barmaid. Do you know how long I've waited for me... My friends, I slept with many women in my glory days. Lawyers, professors, poets, doctors, professional riders, and animators... A butcher, a baker, a candle maker. Yes, we got to the part where it rhymes. A teacher, a restorative, an observer... A puppeteer, a croupier, a housewife, it is also a job, guys. A circuit court judge...<br /><br />Robin: Abbreviates!<br /><br />Barney: I never, never slept with a barmaid sexy, until tonight.<br /><br />Robin: It's not so sexy.<br /><br />Ted: Would you jealous of the attention? Imagined would be the sexiest girl in the bar?<br /><br />Robin: No. Shut up!<br /><br />Barney: Wish me luck.<br /><br />Lily: It will never happen. She will pretend to enjoy yourself in the same way she has mesmerized all these geniuses.<br /><br />Barney: Guess who will not fall under his spell? I will make him &quot;Do not try, baby. Papa needs a gin and tonic. &quot;And when she will, I recracherai saying&quot; Do it again. &quot; The dominant male where it should be: on top, and after a few minutes below. Why should I do anything?<br /><br />Marshall arrives.<br /><br />Marshall: Guys, what's up?<br /><br />Lily: A new super sexy barmaid.<br /><br />Robin: You see? Marshall does not think she's sexy.<br /><br />Lily: If he thinks. Do not bother to pretend that other women are not attractive just for my own good.<br /><br />Marshall: I know, and if this woman was almost as sexy as mine, so I admit, but it is not the case.<br /><br />Lily: Baby, you're an angel, but compared to this woman, I am a big trash bag 3 days.<br /><br />Marshall: I say what I see, and... I think until you're the most beautiful woman in the world.<br /><br />Lily: You see, it's really annoying.<br /><br />Barmaid: You're so funny. It'll be $ 6.75.<br /><br />Man: There's, 50, keep the change.<br /><br />Barmaid: Thank you.<br /><br />Barney: Amateurs.<br /><br />Barmaid: What do you want?<br /><br />Barney: Do not even try, baby. Wait, what?<br /><br />Barmaid: You're going to stay there in order to be ridiculous?<br /><br />Barney: Uh...<br /><br />Barmaid: I do not know a Heu. It's half vodka and half-bar of yourself then?<br /><br />Ted (2030): That night I went to a very important first date.<br /><br />Ted is in the student with whom he spoke earlier.<br /><br />Ted: How are you?<br /><br />Student: Okay. Between.<br /><br />Ted (2030): It's funny, sometimes you walk into an apartment for the first time, but it was the feeling of being right where it should be. And children, it was the first time I saw the little yellow bus of your mother. You know him. It is right behind you.<br /><br />Ted: It's cute.<br /><br />Student: Actually, this is my roommate.<br /><br />Ted (2030): And so I was there in the apartment of your mother, except that I was dating her roommate, Cindy.<br /><br />Ted: Sorry, I should not play with the affairs of your roommate.She look like?<br /><br />Ted (2030): I do not know, but I would hear the first description of the woman I would marry.<br /><br />Cindy: That is a whore. I think this is a dominatrix.<br /><br />Ted: What?<br /><br />Cindy: Okay, sorry, this is not true. I have a roommate complex.<br /><br />Ted: Why?<br /><br />Cindy: The guys always fall in love with her.<br /><br />Ted: Look at me. I promise, I would not fall in love with your roommate.<br /><br />Ted (2030): Oops!<br /><br />At the bar, Marshall brings beers.<br /><br />Lily: Now that you have been looking more closely, admit it: the bartender is the sexiest of the Bar.<br /><br />Robin: The second sexiest.<br /><br />Marshall: I repeat...<br /><br />Lily: Baby, how can you not want you to do? I want to do it. If you do not wanna do it, sorry, but you must be gay.<br /><br />Marshall: Yeah, I'm gay. Gay for you.<br /><br />Barney: No matter. You understand why I'm the only guy she does not know this bar?<br /><br />Marshall: Yes... You will not like the answer.<br /><br />Flashback<br /><br />2 minutes ago...<br /><br />Barmaid: My last three were former Wall Street brokers.Bastards. I swore never to go out with a guy who wears suits.<br /><br />End flashback<br /><br />Barney: It's easy. I just have to stop wearing costumes.<br /><br />Robin: Is that all? Come on, you're always in costume.<br /><br />Summer 2009, Barney skied in costume.<br /><br />Barney: True... But for these two... And, for that... Finally, for her... I'll stop wearing, wait...<br /><br />Robin: We know you're gonna say &quot;costumes&quot;.<br /><br />Barney costumes.<br /><br />Ted and Cindy are in the restaurant.<br /><br />Ted (2030): Meanwhile, Cindy and I spent a pleasant evening, but she was not kidding about his roommate complex.<br /><br />Cindy: Another weird thing on my roommate: she paints robots who play sports.<br /><br />Ted: It's strange.<br /><br />Ted (2030): I lied. It looked great. The watercolor of the robot playing volleyball with your mother is still in remission.<br /><br />Cindy: And she has this weird habit of blackmailing his breakf.<br /><br />Ted: It's weird.<br /><br />Ted (2030): The version of &quot;Memories&quot; of your mother, sung by an English muffin, is to date the most beautiful thing I've heard in my life.<br /><br />Ted: Look, I am defeated. I hate it.<br /><br />Cindy: Sorry. It is not so bad. I'm just a little jealous.<br /><br />Ted: I do not know why. You're great.<br /><br />Ted (2030): But not as much as your mother. And speaking of things that are less brilliant, your uncle Barney was formally arrested costumes.<br /><br /><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content">

</div><br /><br />Barney is at McLaren's, in jeans and T-shirt.<br /><br />Barmaid: Sorry to have misjudged you. If there is a kind of men I can not stand are those in costume. Ca, and a woman who does not comply.<br /><br />Barney: The costumes and complexed. I hate them. I hate them.<br /><br />Ted joined Robin, Lily and Marshall sitting at their usual table.<br /><br />Robin: So, your date with Cindy?<br /><br />Ted: Well, last night, it was nice today, less.<br /><br />Lily: Why?<br /><br />Flashback<br /><br />At the University...<br /><br />Cindy: I discovered that the settlement on all outgoing students and teachers are very strict. I could lose my scholarship.<br /><br />Ted: It's not like if you followed my progress. It is not even in the same department.<br /><br />Cindy: Sorry, but I can not take that risk.<br /><br />End flashback<br /><br />Ted: She exaggerates, there, right?<br /><br />Robin: Well, Ted, she's right.<br /><br />Lily: And thoughtful. If the rules are so strict, you could put your work in.<br /><br />Marshall: I think you should leave it, buddy.<br /><br />Ted: Okay, I start again. She exaggerates, there, right?<br /><br />Ted (2030): Of course they were right. I had to let her go, but as your uncle Barney was discovered, it is not always easy.<br /><br />Barney is looking for clothes in her wardrobe.<br /><br />Barney conscience: In costume.<br /><br />Ted (2030): None of us had seen for so long without Barney costume, and children, it was not pretty.<br /><br />Marshall joined the others at the bar, in costume.<br /><br />Marshall: Sorry for my delay. I was stuck at work. I had this presentation on taxes on dividends.<br /><br />Lily: Of course, I listened carefully when you spoke.<br /><br />Marshall: So, I started the Powerpoint... (rubs Barney costume at Marshall) Barney?<br /><br />Barney locks himself in the bathroom where he finds a suit.<br /><br />Barney conscience: In costume.<br /><br />He finds himself in a suit when Marshall picks him.<br /><br />Marshall: We will order food.<br /><br />Barney: I arrive in a second.<br /><br />Marshall and Barney restarts off his costume. He cracked his suit jacket.<br /><br />Barney, running down the street: Out of my way! Stay with me.It's not your time.<br /><br />Ted (2030): If someone could fix such a thing, it was the tailor personnel Barney, TV's Tim Gunn.<br /><br />Barney is his tailor.<br /><br />Tim: Sorry, Barney. There is nothing more to do.<br /><br />Barney: So young. You can not do anything else?<br /><br />Tim: No. But we can use the buttons on this costume to another.<br /><br />Barney: It can... As an organ donor?<br /><br />Tim: The death of this suit could save the life of another.<br /><br />Barney: But I... Do it.<br /><br />Tim: You do what it takes. Do not cry about it. It's silk.<br /><br />Barney: Sorry. I know. I know.<br /><br />Barney joined Marshall, Lily, Ted and Robin at the bar, with an urn in his hands.<br /><br />Barney: We have the remains cremated. Its buttons have saved a sick jacket of the Upper East Side.<br /><br />Robin: Finally, you can abandon the quest for so-called sexy barmaid.<br /><br />Barney: No. My costume gave his life for this cause, and I do not should rest before these two... Well, it... Finally,... Be it mine.<br /><br />Ted: There is absolutely right.<br /><br />Lily: Who, the guy who kisses an urn full of ashes costume. This guy?<br /><br />Ted: What if Cindy is the woman I am to marry, and I give up?Farewell, elegant but cozy house in Westchester, with a reasonable loan that I can pay without ruining me. Goodbye, the two children raised in a strict but loving hand, finding the perfect balance between the father and friend. Adios, triplets Schnauzers, Frank Lloyd Wright and. The fact is, I do not give up either! (Ted gets up and kissed the urn of Barney before leaving) I do not know why I did that.<br /><br />Barmaid: Barney, sorry about your friend. Tell me about him.<br /><br />Barney: It was Italian. Classic, elegant. And my God he knew how to deal with women. They could not say no.<br /><br />Barmaid: How old was he?<br /><br />Barney: 7 years. I miss him so much!<br /><br />Barmaid: You should not be alone tonight. I will finish earlier.<br /><br />Barney: Thank you, old friend. You go on a good shot.<br /><br />Barney share with the barmaid.<br /><br />Lily: Admit it, she is sexier than me. It will not hurt me.<br /><br />Marshall: I can not. You're sexier than she.<br /><br />Lily: That's a goddess! Her skin glows. Her legs are super long.And that ass? I do not mind having it, even on the head! That night, I admit, I thought about it a little more than once.<br /><br />Marshall: What do you...? Kind, you think she is sexier than me?<br /><br />Lily: I never said that.<br /><br />Marshall: You think so!<br /><br />Lily: It's not comparable. She is younger than you.<br /><br />Marshall: I'm just, like, me, my friend, against it, its old.<br /><br />Robin: You two, the fact that it is not real sexy! She is sexy thanks to circumstances! Look.<br /><br />Robin takes off his jacket and goes behind the counter.<br /><br />Marshall: I guess you also think she is sexier than me.<br /><br />Carl: What are you doing?<br /><br />Robin: What?<br /><br />Carl: You do not have the right to be there.<br /><br />Robin: Carl, listening. No. I do not want to leave. Mercy, mercy, do not force me to leave.<br /><br />Carl: You have to go. You have to go.<br /><br />Robin: I was someone there, behind! Everybody loved me.<br /><br />Ted walking in the rain. A knock at Cindy.<br /><br />Ted: Can we talk?<br /><br />Cindy: My roommate is going out of the shower. Come into my room.<br /><br />Ted: I know the law prohibits us from going out together. But he also says &quot;Do not teach in having drunk&quot; and I do it all the time.The fact is... I really appreciate you. You're cute, funny. You write a thesis which is entitled, Foreign direct investment and intergenerational ties of consumption behavior. It's too sexy! I know it sounds crazy, but... I feel that our paths are supposed to meet, and... I do not want to miss meeting you.<br /><br />Cindy: I do not want it, me either.<br /><br />Ted: I gotta tell you, just by looking at your room, I know we have much in common.<br /><br />Cindy: Really?<br /><br />Ted: The Unicorns? Who will cut our hair When We're Gone? I thought I was the only one with this album.<br /><br />Cindy: This is my roommate. I borrowed.<br /><br />Ted: And that? After World T.C Boyle?<br /><br />Cindy: Birthday present... my roommate. I did not read it yet.<br /><br />Ted: You should. It is really good. And that? It is the height. You play the bass? Seriously, ask my friends. I have always said that my perfect woman... does not play bass, because that is clearly that of your roommate.<br /><br />Cindy: It is in a group.<br /><br />Ted: Damn, that's cool.<br /><br />Cindy: It's amazing. You chose the only three things that are here to my roommate.<br /><br />Ted: The group played shows your roommate or...?<br /><br />Cindy: Get out.<br /><br />Ted (2030): Children, as you guessed, it was not the night I met your mother. Although I think I saw his foot. But I approached the meeting with the woman of my dreams. And your mother... She had recovered her yellow umbrella.<br /><br />Barney the bartender back home.<br /><br />Barney: It was so special, you know? We should observe a minute of silence. Followed by about 20 minutes of grunting.<br /><br />Barmaid: I'll help you feel much better. Let me refresh.<br /><br />Barney: Okay. Expected. No, this is not the bathroom. This is...<br /><br />Barmaid: They are yours?<br /><br />Barney: I'm the suit-sitting for someone.<br /><br />Barmaid: Barney, you lied to me. You must choose immediately.Me... or costumes.<br /><br />The barmaid hand.<br /><br />Barney, singing and dancing in the street: I know what you're thinking, &quot;What Barney has been drinking? This girl was hot! &quot;I might have to do it, but I did not miss anything because there is something she is not. 10 would make me a lot, but I'd rather be on my 31. It is a fact that you can not deny. Nothing goes better than n'me costume! Imagine a world where men and women are perfectly well-dressed! The delivery man in suit and tie savate, this puppy in a cross! This guy with sideburns, this baby with a pacifier! This gendarmette deliciously beautiful. Nothing goes better than n'leur costume! A first officer that I can wear, they are oh so distinguished! The perfect trick to get me a girl with father issues, navy blue or black! (2 men get out of a store with a rack filled with costumes) spy on this perfect rack! I want to make guilis.<br /><br />Marshall, doing the same: Oh, really! Then answer these questions, I beg. What would you do if you had to choose between your suits and a pot of gold?<br /><br />Barney: Costumes!<br /><br />Marshall: What would you say, against all your costume you were offered eternal youth?<br /><br />Barney: Costumes!<br /><br />Robin: What would you choose: a million girls and one three parts?<br /><br />Barney: Do we see.<br /><br />Lily: And a world at peace would be within your reach?<br /><br />Barney: I'll stop. These are the costumes. Stops just bullshit.Two, three, four! Girls come and depart, but the clothes remain constant! Each buddy dépote and rambling, it is no substitute!Sorry, my costumes, I give you my life. My Sunday clothes are my best friends! The casual clothes go in the basket because nothing goes better with the undisputed often praised, claiming to fame... a true... Expect more... Costume...<br /><br />Ted, Marshall, Lily: Nothing suits her better... than... Costume.In costume! In costume! Costume...!<br /><br />Barney: Mind you, it is rather barrel. (Back at Barney) I choose you you, baby. Tomorrow morning, I get rid of these costumes.<br /><br />Barmaid: Really?<br /><br />Barney: Yeah. (They kiss) I will do you nothing!<br /><br />END
