						<em>Kids, the early bloom of a romance is a wonderful thing. You meet someone, you have a connection, and that person becomes sheer perfection in your eyes. You just can't find anything wrong with them. And you can't wait to tell the world about it.</em><br /><br />She convinced you to go jogging?<br /><br />Wow, you really want to get in this girl's pants.<br /><br />I'm telling you, you guys are gonna love her.<br /><br />Lily, she knows all about art.<br /><br />Marshall, she's open to the existence of UFOs.<br /><br />Barney, she's hot. Robin, she's not hotter than you.<br /><br />Like her already.<br /><br />How not hotter?<br /><br /><em>So we all went out to dinner, and I couldn't wait to see if my friends were as crazy about Cathy as I was.</em><br /><br />So, what's everyone getting?<br /><br />Well, I can't decide.<br /><br />Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?<br /><br />Lasagna. Just get the lasagna!<br /><br />Oh. You guys just got a new place.<br /><br />How many bedrooms is it?<br /><br />Two. It's two bedrooms!<br /><br />Okay! Let's hear it.<br /><br />What's wrong with Cathy?<br /><br />Are you kidding me, Ted?<br /><br />She's got a...<br /><br />Wait! You don't notice it?<br /><br />Notice what?<br /><br />Oh, he doesn't see it.<br /><br />If we point it out, we're gonna ruin her for him.<br /><br />As his friends, we'll just keep him in the dark.<br /><br />You're right.<br /><br />She's great, man.<br /><br />She's a keeper. Just... keep her somewhere else.<br /><br />Marshall, what is everyone's problem with Cathy?<br /><br />Oh, she's a total nightmare, Ted, but can we talk about this later?<br /><br />I'm a minute away from finding out if I'm gonna be a lawyer or not.<br /><br /><em>You see, kids, during the summer, Marshall had taken the New York Bar exam. His years of school, his countless hours of study, had finally culminated in this grueling, two-day ordeal.</em><br /><br />And... begin.<br /><br /><em>The pressure of it was enormous. Every year, people taking the bar simply cracked. But Marshall had made it through.</em><br /><br />And...<br /><br />time.<br /><br />Time's up.<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />Time.<br /><br />Sir.<br /><br />I know.<br /><br />Your time is...<br /><br />I know it is.<br /><br />Give me...!<br /><br /><em>Now, months later, the results of that exam were scheduled to post online at 10:00, and it was 9:59.</em><br /><br />Damn, they're not up yet.<br /><br />Oh, don't worry, baby. I'm sure you rocked it.<br /><br />I mean, how many people fail the bar?<br /><br />Half.<br /><br />Oh, my God, half? Only half the people pass?<br /><br />I mean, half the people pass. That's fantastic.<br /><br />Go, Marshall.<br /><br />Oh, hey, can I jump on there? I want to show you something awesome.<br /><br />What? No, no. Bar results. My future.<br /><br />Trust me. You need to see this.<br /><br />What is so important that I need to see it right now?<br /><br />It's a video of a dog pooping on a baby.<br /><br />How do I need to see that?<br /><br />Why would I want to see that?<br /><br />In what possible way could subjecting my eyes and my brain to something that disgusting enrich my life?<br /><br />It's a dog pooping on a baby.<br /><br />Get away from my computer.<br /><br />Okay, just do a quick Google search for &quot;caca spaniel.&quot;<br /><br />The results are in.<br /><br />Whoo. What's it say?<br /><br />&quot;Input password.&quot;<br /><br />Input the password !<br /><br />It's okay. They assigned it to me when I took the test.<br /><br />It's gotta be around here somewhere.<br /><br />Here. Here-here-here-here.<br /><br />Jelly beans, fluffernutter, Gummi Bears, ginger snaps...<br /><br />This is a grocery list For who? A witch building a house in the forest?<br /><br />Sugar helps me study.<br /><br />This is like the shopping a ten-year-old does when his parents leave him alone for the weekend.<br /><br />What parent leaves a ten-<br />year-old alone for the weekend?<br /><br />And your mom was perfect.<br /><br />I can't find my password!<br /><br />Okay, just... can't you let 'em know that you lost it and they'll e-mail it to you or something?<br /><br />No! They won't let me do that. I'm gonna have to wait till the results come in the regular mail. That could be weeks from now, if ever!<br /><br />Our mail carrier hates me ever since I asked her when the baby was due.<br /><br />She wasn't pregnant?<br /><br />No, he was not.<br /><br />Okay, well, that's a drag, but the results will come eventually.<br /><br />Just try to keep it off your mind until then.<br /><br />Hey, Brad.<br /><br />Oh, congratulations, man.<br /><br />I'm, uh... I'm not sure yet. I...<br /><br />lost my password.<br /><br />That's great, Cara.<br /><br />I don't know yet. I lost my password.<br /><br />I don't know how I lost it!<br /><br />This stuff happens!<br /><br />You're one to talk. You misplace stuff all the time.<br /><br />I'm sorry. I'm sure the nurses are stealing your medicine, Grandma.<br /><br />Love you, too.<br /><br />If I have to wait six weeks to find out if I passed, I'm gonna have a heart attack.<br /><br />Based on that grocery list, I'd say diabetes is a bigger worry.<br /><br />You know what? Laugh all you want.<br /><br />This affects my whole future, all right?<br /><br />Okay. I probably shouldn't be telling you this.<br /><br />I definitely shouldn't be telling you this, but there is a way I can help you with your problem.<br /><br />How?<br /><br />I know a guy at work.<br /><br />He can get access to software designed to penetrate firewalls and retrieve passwords through secure servers.<br /><br />I can get into any computer.<br /><br />So what do we do?<br /><br />Like, arrange a secret meeting in a darkened parking structure?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Can we?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />I have a trench coat.<br /><br />Dude, be cool.<br /><br />So, I just got off the phone with Cathy.<br /><br />God, you guys are so right. I totally hear it now.<br /><br />See it now?<br /><br />Smell it?<br /><br />What is it?!<br /><br />I left the table for two minutes.<br /><br />What could she have possibly done in that time that was so horrible?<br /><br />Was it...<br /><br />I'll be back in one second.<br /><br />One time, in the tenth grade, as a joke, I told everyone that my English teacher had s*x with me.<br /><br />He's still in jail.<br /><br />Or maybe...<br /><br />I'll be back in a second.<br /><br />So I volunteer at the pound.<br /><br />Oh, isn't that nice?<br /><br />Yeah.<br /><br />You can't imagine the rush you get from killing an unwanted puppy.<br /><br />I make bracelets out of the collars.<br /><br />Or...<br /><br />I'll be back in one second.<br /><br />I bet he's going to the urinal.<br /><br />Yeah. I remember when I had a pen1s.<br /><br />It wasn't anything she did while you were in the bathroom.<br /><br />It's just the way she is.<br /><br />I don't get it. If it's so obvious and you guys all see it, how come I don't?<br /><br />'Cause we're not trying to have s*x with her.<br /><br />Brother, you're driving the &quot;I want to have s*x with her&quot; truck, and it's got a huge blind spot.<br /><br />That's ridiculous.<br /><br />Is it really?<br /><br />Ted, let me tell you a little story about a young lady I wanted to have s*x with...<br /><br />Lucilia.<br /><br />On a white sand beach in Rio de Janeiro, we made love for ten straight hours.<br /><br />When we were done, she applauded and told me I was far, far better than the best lover she could possibly imagine, and that I had restored her faith in God.<br /><br />What does this have to do with Cathy?<br /><br />Who's Cathy?<br /><br />Just tell me what the hell is wrong with her already.<br /><br />Okay. You want to know?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />You want to shatter this beautiful illusion you've created for yourself?<br /><br />Fine. Here it is.<br /><br />Cathy talks...<br /><br />a lot.<br /><br />Oh, come on. That's not true.<br /><br />Ted. Really, really think about that dinner we all just had together.<br /><br /><em>And I did.</em><br /><br />So, what's everyone getting?<br /><br />Well, I can't decide.<br /><br />Which sounds better, chicken or lasagna?<br /><br />I like chicken. I like lasagna. I like them both, but I really like pork. A lot of people don't eat pork, and maybe it's because of that movie Babe or something.<br /><br />But that was funny. He was a talking pig and he was like &quot;Bah, Ram, Ewe!&quot;<br /><br />What-what if there was a sorority, &quot;Bah, Ram, Ewe?&quot;<br /><br />I'd totally rush it. ...And so I named him Dr. Seuss!<br /><br />Lorax is a funny word.<br /><br />Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!<br /><br />Oh, you guys just got a new place.<br /><br />How many bedrooms is it?<br /><br />I would love to have an extra bedroom, because I would put a Stairmaster in there.<br /><br />But you guys should get a convertible sofa.<br /><br />Or a futon. Futons are great. Or what about one of those Murphy beds?<br /><br />Who invented the Murphy bed? Was it a guy named Murphy?<br /><br />Oh, my God. Do you guys remember that show Murphy Brown?<br /><br />That was a funny show. She had a new assistant every episode. ...and it was like half an hour before I realized he wasn't even on the phone anymore! Isn't that hysterical?<br /><br />Two! It's two bedrooms!<br /><br />Hey, do you guys like cannolis?<br /><br />Because I know this place and it's in the South Bronx and you wouldn't expect it, but they have the best cannolis in town.<br /><br /><em>And just like that, the illusion was shattered.</em><br /><br />She just never shuts up, does she?<br /><br />She didn't stop to swallow her food.<br /><br />I was scared for her. I didn't want her to choke.<br /><br />At first.<br /><br /><em>So kids, this girls I was dating would not stop talking. Can you imagine how awful that is?</em><br /><br />Do you own a wok?<br /><br />'Cause that's really how...<br /><br />Don't you just love autumn?<br /><br />Today I'm dressed for... Oh, my God. The sweetest thing.<br /><br />And I know this great place where we can go.<br /><br />They have guys and girls clothes. We could both shop at the same time.<br /><br />And a lot of times boyfriends and girlfriends...<br /><br />Hey! Why are you running so fast?<br /><br />Well, thank you, pal. You and your little friends, you just had to tell me.<br /><br />You just had to give in to my incessant begging.<br /><br />You said that you wanted to know.<br /><br />I didn't want to know!<br /><br />You said you wanted to know!<br /><br />Well, I didn't know I didn't want to know! You knew.<br /><br />And you know me. And you should have known I didn't want to know!<br /><br />You know?<br /><br />I'm sorry we told you. I'm surprised she didn't tell you herself at some point.<br /><br />There's only a finite combination of words in the English language.<br /><br />Well, you could have let me enjoy it a little longer.<br /><br />She's got all these other great qualities. She's smart.<br /><br />She's caring. She loves animals...<br /><br />You know how to teach her a lesson? Buy her a parrot.<br /><br />Oh, come on. I'm sorry that we told you, okay?<br /><br />It's part of being in a relationship.<br /><br />Eventually, you get used to these annoying little things that bug you at first.<br /><br />Yeah, I guess.<br /><br />I mean, you got used to Lily's loud chewing, right?<br /><br />Lily doesn't chew loudly.<br /><br />Dude... Come on. This isn't news.<br /><br />Why do you think I call her &quot;Chewbacca&quot;?<br /><br />I assumed because she's loyal, wears shiny belts and I resemble a young Harrison Ford.<br /><br />Think about it.<br /><br />Oh, man, honestly, dude, that's the meanest thing you've ever done to me.<br /><br />I really thought you knew.<br /><br />We had ribs the other night. It sounded like Jurassic Park.<br /><br />Ha-ha-ha. You know what? It doesn't matter.<br /><br /><em>But it did.</em><br /><br />Say, what's in that cereal besides dry twigs and small animal bones?<br /><br />What's that supposed to mean?<br /><br />Lily, I love you, but honest to God, when you eat, it sounds like a garbage disposal full of drywall screws.<br /><br />What's the matter with you?<br /><br />We've been together ten years, and you're saying this now?<br /><br />Well, I never noticed it before until...<br /><br />Until what?<br /><br />Can you believe Ted? What a lame thing to say, that I'm a loud chewer.<br /><br />Yeah, that's crazy.<br /><br />Maybe enough with the pretzels.<br /><br />Oh, my God, do I really chew that loudly?<br /><br />No, no, no.<br /><br />Okay, now that you pointed it out, maybe it does sound slightly like someone put a screwdriver in a pencil sharpener, but in a cute way.<br /><br /><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content">

This is a facial tissue.<br /><br />Oh, my God, is Frankenstein gonna kill that little girl?<br /><br />Uh, Dr. Frankenstein isn't in this scene.<br /><br />That's Frankenstein's monster.<br /><br />That literally blew my mind.<br /><br />Figuratively.<br /><br />Oh, my God, you're right.<br /><br />That is so annoying.<br /><br />Isn't it?<br /><br />Where are those pretzels from, Ace Hardware?<br /><br />Hey, man, you like kettle corn? I'm trying to get rid of anything crunchy.<br /><br />Are the blinds closed?<br /><br />I don't know.<br /><br />Are the blinds closed?!<br /><br />Yes, the blinds are closed.<br /><br />Good, I didn't think I was followed, but you can never be too sure.<br /><br />Now double-lock the door and stay away from the windows.<br /><br />Is there a reason that you're acting like this?<br /><br />We're about to find out if you're a lawyer.<br /><br />Now, in good conscience, I have to inform you that using this software is in violation of the Patriot Act, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the National Security Act of 1948, which created the CIA.<br /><br />So I hope you passed the bar because if we use this software, the night janitor Gligor who I fooled into putting fingerprints on my computer, is going to need a good lawyer.<br /><br />Are you certain you want to go through with this?<br /><br />I have to know, yes, yes.<br /><br />Very good.<br /><br />First, we go to the New York State Bar Web site.<br /><br />We disable the firewall, then the recursive algorithm grabs your password, and as the application erases itself leaving no trace we were here ever...<br /><br />you ready to see your future, bro?<br /><br />Yes.<br /><br />It's a dog pooping on a baby.<br /><br />Right!

You drink it?<br /><br />Is that how water works?<br /><br />Because I was just gonna smear it on my skin and hope that I absorbed it.<br /><br />Or you could, you know, pour it over your shirt.<br /><br />What's with you?<br /><br />You're always correcting people.<br /><br />You totally do that!<br /><br />That's absolutely right.<br /><br />Right? I never noticed it before, and now it's literally driving me crazy.<br /><br />Figuratively.<br /><br />Okay, maybe so, but it's no worse than you using the word &quot;literally&quot;<br /><br />in every other sentence.<br /><br />Don't they teach vocabulary in Canada?<br /><br />They literally don't.

Heading down to the basement today With my laundry and a roll of quarters But I'm back too soon 'cause I left the detergent and the fabric softener</em><br /><br />Those lines are so sloppy.<br /><br />Oh, come on!<br /><br />What about you, &quot;Barney&quot;?<br /><br />Okay, you...<br /><br />always...<br /><br />Interesting, interesting, everyone has annoying habits but me.<br /><br />Oh, got it.<br /><br />Okay, you sometimes talk in a weird high-pitched voice.<br /><br />And you're constantly using lame catchphrases.<br /><br />And sometimes you space out and don't even pay attention to what we're talking about.<br /><br />I'm sorry. What?<br /><br />Oh, see? You can't think of anything 'Cause I'm awesome!<br /><br />All three right there.<br /><br />Well, technically, &quot;awesome&quot; wouldn't be a catchphrase.<br /><br />If anything, it's more of a catchword.<br /><br />I literally want to rip your head off.<br /><br />You mean &quot;figuratively&quot;!<br /><br />No, I literally mean &quot;literally.&quot;<br /><br />Literally, literally, literally.<br /><br />Oh, my God, Lily, what are you eating, gravel?<br /><br />Oh, I know, right? It sounds like cufflinks going up a vacuum cleaner.<br /><br />Well, why don't you sing about it?<br /><br />Because I don't sing about everything I do.<br /><br />No, no, sometimes you just sing nonsense sentences like a stroke victim, and what's worse, they're catchy.<br /><br /><em>Apple, orchard, banana, cat dance, 8663</em><br /><br />See? We know that one because once you sang that for, like, three hours. What the hell is that?<br /><br />That's my password.<br /><br />AOBCD8663.<br /><br />Oh, Marshall!<br /><br />Awesome!<br /><br />There's another one. It's called &quot;Golden Reliever,&quot; where this dog...<br /><br />Yeah, we can guess.<br /><br />All right, guys, guys, guys.<br /><br />I'm a lawyer.<br /><br /><em>And just like that we stopped fighting and celebrated Marshall's success.<br /><br />You see, when someone's bad habits are pointed out to you, it's hard to ignore them.<br /><br />I'm a lawyer now 'cause I passed the bar I'm imposing Marshall law on this champagne.</em><br /><br />Oh my God, are you literally on cloud nine right now?<br /><br />Baby, you never have to take the bar again.<br /><br />Actually, if he practices law in another state, he will have to, but New York, man! It's a great state to practice law in!<br /><br />Lawsuit up!<br /><br /><em>But if you love them enough, those bad habits are easy to forget. Three years later, I ran in to Cathy</em> and she was doing well.<br /><br />Ted?! Oh, my God, I haven't seen you in so long! How long has it been?<br /><br />Three years? No, four. No, three, 'cause I went blonde and then I went back 'cause I was having too much fun.<br /><br />It's true what they say: blondes have more fun.<br /><br />Oh, my God, I'm being so rude.<br /><br />Ted, this is my fiancé. Yes, I'm engaged.<br /><br />Ted, this is Daniel.<br /><br />Daniel... this is Ted.<br /><br />Great, great, nice to meet you.<br /><br />You guys seem perfect for each other.<br /><br />Oh, my God. I know, right? Totally, it was like love at first sight.<br /><br />Hey, we should go out sometime. Are you seeing anyone?<br /><br />Because we could double-date. That... ? No, it's not weird.<br /><br />We can go have brunch out the street. I know this place.<br /><br />Do you guys like popovers?<br /><br />Because I love popovers.<br /><br />She sur can talk a lot, huh?<br /><br />They're like croissants, but they're a little bit less flaky and they're kind of round.<br /><br />Hey, they have strawberry jam.
